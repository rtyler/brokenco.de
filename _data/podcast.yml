    description: |
      German is not one language and speech-to-text programs have trouble with dialects or variants of German. This "Alltags Deutsch" <a href="https://www.dw.com/de/versteisch-du-schwiizerdütsch/l-54542550?maca=de-DKpodcast_alltagsdeutsch_de-2283-xml-mrss">episode</a> introduces the challenges Siri, etc have with understanding Swiss-german.

  - title: "Down with the emperor!"

      <a href="https://missiontozyxx.space">Mission to Zyxx</a> is one of my favorite comedy podcasts. It's entirely improvised and has some absolutely stunning sound engineering. This is the first episode of season three and includes fantastic orchestral musical interludes and is a genuinely funny beginning to the next chapter of the series.

  - title: "Afrofuturism"
    description: |
      Before listening to this <a href="https://www.imaginaryworldspodcast.org">Imaginary Worlds</a> episode I had never heard of the term "Afrofuturism". The first sentence of this episode's description had me hooked: "Sun Ra claimed to be an extraterrestrial being from Saturn who could teleport you to other planets with his music."  Yes please! I enjoy jazz from the classics to the bizarre 70's era experimentation (e.g. Bitches Brew from Miles Davis, etc), into modern retellings of old standards but I had never heard of "Sun Ra" and listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG5f2w-K5jo">him on YouTube</a> has been quite the treat.

  - title: 'Kudos to the snake lobby, part 1'
    description: |
      <p>Somehow I have recently heard not one, but <strong>two</strong> unrelated podcasts both talk about snake bites and anti-venom. I don't know what the deal is but kudos to whoever is doing the marketing for the challenges of snake bites and anti-venom out there.</p>
      <p>The first comes from <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible</a> which had a pretty interesting dive into how snake anti-venoms are made</p>

    description: |
      <p>The second snakey episode I heard, within practically a week of the previous episode linked, was from another fun/informative podcast called <a href="https://www.flashforwardpod.com/">Flash Forward</a>. The premise of this podcast is always framed as "what if.." about the future with experts talking about the realistic possibilities of what the future of a specific topic might bring.</p>
      <p>This episode is strictly about anti-venoms and snakes like the previous, but the first part of the episode definitely had me experiencing a bit of <em>deja vu</em>.

  - title: 'Quinten, Switzerland'
    description: |
      <p>
        This "Alltags Deutsch" episode highlights an idyllic little village on the far side of a lake in Switzerland that is seeking new inhabitants. The downside: it's really only accessible by boat, the upside: they want young families and will pay about 185 euro per child per month to move there. Old folks need not apply.

      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately the episode doesn't talk about what kind of internet connectivity they have, a small house near a beautiful swiss lake could be <em>very</em> convincing ... if they've got gigabit!
