Words cannot express how excited I am for the coming margin squeeze on _every_
"AI company" that isn't Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, or Google. The _entire_
industry is built on an unethical foundation, having illegitimately acquired
[massive
amounts](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=openai+copyright+infringement&ia=news&iar=news)
of
[content](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/meta-pirated-and-seeded-porn-for-years-to-train-ai-lawsuit-says/)
from practically _everybody_. The companies selling "AI Coding Assistants" I am particularly excited to see implode.

Every "AI Coding Assistant" uses Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on the
open source ecosystem and every one of those models **is** violating the
licenses of every piece of code they were trained on. 

My code has been slurped up into these models and is being used to
create derived works without attribution, thereby violating the software I have
personally licensed under MIT, Apache Software License 2.0, LGPL, AGPL, or GPLv3.

I saw a fun quote in this post [from TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/the-high-costs-and-thin-margins-threatening-ai-coding-startups/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=mastodon):

Kudos to the author [Marina
Tempkin](https://techcrunch.com/author/marina-temkin/) for calling bullshit on
the delusion that "inference will get cheaper."

It will only get more expensive. It is a matter of _when_ not _if_. Investors
have poured billionrs into OpenAI for example, and they are expecting a massive
return. The only way that happens is by OpenAI successfully executing the
"YouTube Playbook": run at a loss as fast as you can, get massive scale, corner
the market, then pivot to monetization.

The companies built entirely with OpenAI API calls and little other "moat" are
destined to have their margins squeezed _hard_ and then wink out of existence.


I wish them all the best of luck in their future endeavors.

Think I'm salty? Read [this great post from Marcus
Hutchins](https://malwaretech.com/2025/08/every-reason-why-i-hate-ai.html)
which has a much longer and thoughtful take on the entire ecosystem.
