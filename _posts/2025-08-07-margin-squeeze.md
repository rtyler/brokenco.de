Words cannot express how excited I am for the coming margin squeeze on _every_
"AI company" that isn't Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, or Google. The _entire_
industry is built on an unethical foundation, having illegitimately acquired
[massive
amounts](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=openai+copyright+infringement&ia=news&iar=news)
of
[content](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/meta-pirated-and-seeded-porn-for-years-to-train-ai-lawsuit-says/)
from practically _everybody_. The companies selling "AI Coding Assistants" I am particular excited to see implode.

Every "AI Coding Assistant" uses Large Language Models (LLMs) that are trained
on the open source ecosystem and **are** violating the licenses of effectively
every piece of code they were trained on. 

My code has been slurped up into these models and is certainly being used to
create derived works without attribution thereby violating the software I have
personally released as MIT, Apache Software License 2.0, LGPL, AGPL, or GPLv3.


I saw a fun quote in this post [from TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/the-high-costs-and-thin-margins-threatening-ai-coding-startups/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=mastodon):

Kudos to the author [Marina
Tempkin](https://techcrunch.com/author/marina-temkin/) for calling bullshit on
the delusion that "inference will get cheaper."

It will only get more expensive, it is just a matter of _when_ not _if_. The
billions investors have poured into OpenAI for example are expecting a massive
return. The only way that happens is that OpenAI needs to successfully execued
the YouTube Playbook: run at a loss as fast as you can, get massive scale,
corner the market, then pivot to monetization.

The companies built entirely with OpenAI or Geminic inference calls and little
other "moat" are destined to have their margins squeezed and then wink out of
existence.


I wish them all the best of luck in their future endeavors.

Think I'm salty? Read [this great post from Marcus
Hutchins](https://malwaretech.com/2025/08/every-reason-why-i-hate-ai.html)
which has a much longer and thoughtful take on the entire ecosystem.
