title: The y-axis is important

Automated anomaly detection has become invaluable in the observability tools I
rely on for production systems. More advanced vendors like
[Datadog](https://datadoghq.com) have introduced "AI" functionality, which is
really just conventional machine-learning models for proactively identifying
suspicious behavior.

One of the systems I am responsible for is showing a **dramatic** spike in read
latency. I am running a large-ish data ingestion process, so some difference in
load was not unexpected. Looking at the graphs however it _appears_ that
something serious is happening. There's a 4x spike in latency, that can't be
good!

The y-axis is important but the tools sometimes omit a unit, or include
necessary context.

Before unfurling my Jump To Conclusions™ mat I noticed that hte 4x increase
is from 500 **nanoseconds** to 2 _milliseconds_.

For a system which has a latency budget more than an order of magnitude more
than that, this is _not actually a concern_.

In isolation the "Read Latency" spike looks frightening, in the context of the
rest of the metrics, the addition of another millisecond or so doesn't even
register.
