Everything went fine. Social media is awash with anecdotes about getting
vaccinated, side effects, and opinions about _other_ people becoming
vaccinated. I recently crossed the waiting threshold after my last dose and
felt I should share my experiences as well.

I had numerous colleagues take days off of work to lie in bed and endure what
sounded like the unpleasant side effects developing antibodies. In contrast, I
felt _nothing_ out of the ordinary at any point during the vaccination process.
At no point did I even slow down my normal work, exercise, or eating habits,
and I have a hypothesis as to why.

It is unlikely that I am in some secret control group, so I am guessing there
is something about my physiology causing no noticeable side-effects. I am
fairly fit, eat vegetarian, and in my 30s.  I am also a european-descendant
white guy, a particularly common configuration across the United States. Many
but not all of my colleagues and friends who suffered ill-effects after their
shots were of Asian or Indian heritage. This is **not** data and
correlation/causation blah-blah, but I do wonder how [diverse the clinical
trials](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2015/12/401156/diversity-medical-research-long-way-study-shows)
were for the various COVID vaccines or mRNA technology developed in the
many years prior. Regardless, not a single person I know suffered _serious_
side-effects; at worst mild flu=like symptoms manifested and were gone within a
day or two.

Despite the inconvenience, we are all now significantly more resistant to COVID
and less likely to contribute to the propagation of the virus. As a bonus many
have also noted a slight increase in their 5G reception.
