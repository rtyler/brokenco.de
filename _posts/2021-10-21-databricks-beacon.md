A bit of belated news but thanks to all the advocacy work we have been doing at
[Scribd](https://tech.scribd.com)_ I am now a [Databricks
Beacon](https://databricks.com/discover/beacons/tyler-croy). The Beacon program is similar
to Docker Captains, Microsoft MVPs, or Java Champions, a group of folks who are
considered both skilled with the technology and in communicating/sharing best
practices, tips, and short-comings with the broader community.

From the [site](https://databricks.com/discover/beacons/) itself:

> The Databricks Beacons program is our way to thank and recognize the community members, data scientists, data engineers, developers and open source enthusiasts who go above and beyond to uplift the data and AI community.
> 
> Whether they are speaking at conferences, leading workshops, teaching, mentoring, blogging, writing books, creating tutorials, offering support in forums or organizing meetups, they inspire others and encourage knowledge sharing â€“ all while helping to solve tough data problems.


I'm flattered to be included in the inaugural group of Beacons, which include a
number of much more competent data leaders than myself. Most of what I bring to
the table is a *lot* of [Delta Lake](https://delta.io) experience and advocacy.
Delta Lake is the bedrock of Scribd's data platform and I have been investing
heavily in the space with our contribution of the
[delta-rs](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs) Rust bindings, upon which
[kafka-delta-ingest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLmsZ3qYfB0) was built.

[Scribd is a Databricks
customer](https://databricks.com/customers/data-team-effect/scribd), and from
that angle I have been quite impressed with the organization and technologies
they have built. As some folks who have seen [my public talks](https://youtu.be/h5bRBuVmhL4?t=1635) about Databricks,
I also don't hold back in my honest assessment of the platform's strengths and
weaknesses, thus my surprise to be included as a Beacon ;)


I'm looking forward to more events where I am able to share some of the
real-world experiences we're gaining at Scribd in building out massive data
platform systems with Delta Lake and Databricks. And as always, if you want to [help us build out more](https://tech.scribd.com/careers/#open-positions) feel free to email me!
