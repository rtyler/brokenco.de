The process of switching to a more electric house, and therefore more
renewable, is two parts: remove fossil fuel powered components and **remove
load**.
[I wrote previously](/2025/03/07/battery-powered.html)
about using a home battery which has really made a big dent in the ability to switch loads towards electricity. I have recently done some more analysis on the _humble clothesline_.

The clothes dryer is electric, but electric heat is **expensive** unless it's
via a [heat pump](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections). Most of them
use _multiple_ kilowatt hours (kWhs) to dry a load of clothes. My midline model
will chew up almost 5kWh to dry a robust load of laundry. The utility's tiered
rate plan means that of clothes could cost **$1.55** during off-peak or **$3.05** on-peak.

Northern California is typically sunny and dry from April to November, which
makes for easy hang-drying of laundry. I recommend relatively simple
[free-standing hanging
racks](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everyday-Home-23-3-in-x-42-in-Freestanding-Collapsible-Stainless-Steel-Laundry-Drying-Rack-W050049/309795575)
which are easy to shift around depending on the sunlight or wind. I also have a
retractable clothes line which I have yet to install, since i cannot really
find a good stretch across the garden.

_Note:_ Technically you can hang-dry indoors during the winter. That's not as fun, but I still recommend it!

The amount saved through the year is $125-$250 depending on the number of
weekly loads! Removing the electric load reduces costs, because I also have a
home battery there is more surplus electricity to sell _back_ to the utility.
The total value of hang-dried laundry is difficult to accurately quantify, but
it's free money, give it a try!
