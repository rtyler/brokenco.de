Abusive traffic from AI-based bots or application is becoming more prevelant
which is why I'm thrilled to introduce the general availability of
[recoil](https://github.com/rtyler/recoil). Recoil is a highly sophisticated
honeypot which can serve a never-ending stream of data to abusive traffic.


Built with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and
[Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), Recoil is both small and fast, to
allow for easily serving thousands of connections.

According to one reviewer:

> It's not just annoying, it's _efficiently_ annoying.

I hope you find [recoil](https://github.com/rtyler/recoil) a useful addition to your infrastructure!

***nginx protip*** when configuring `recoil` with nginx, but sure to set
`proxy_buffering off;` in the `location {}` block to ensure clients receive
peak performance.
