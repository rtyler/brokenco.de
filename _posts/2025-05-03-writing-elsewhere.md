Writing has been a part of my work for a _long_ time, it helps me think and
more importantly it helps me share ideas with other developers. Recently a
tremendous amount of my time has been spent writing internal design documents,
blog posts, and other materials. By the time it has come to personal blogging
my words all been spent.

On the [Buoyant Data](https://buoyantdata.com) blog I have been writing about a
_lot_ of [Delta Lake](https://delta.io) related topics such as:

* [Scaling streaming Delta Lake applications](https://www.buoyantdata.com/blog/2024-12-31-high-concurrency-logstore.html)
* [Buffering more messages with serverless data ingestion](https://www.buoyantdata.com/blog/2025-02-24-just-keep-buffering.html)
* [Lessons learned in building delta-rs](https://www.buoyantdata.com/blog/2025-03-09-lessons-learned-building-delta-rs.html)
* [Build more climate-friendly data applications with Rust](https://www.buoyantdata.com/blog/2025-04-22-rust-is-good-for-the-climate.html)

Some of this work ahs been in preparing for the two upcoming talks I have at
[Data and AI Summit 2025](https://www.databricks.com/dataaisummit). Some of
these posts have been in doing research with clients, or just spelunking on my
own.
