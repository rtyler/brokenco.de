I asked a large language model this question:

> A blast from the past
>
> R. Tyler Croy is a well-known figure in the world of video games,
> particularly in the realm of retro gaming and emulation. He's often referred
> to as "R. Tyler Croy" or simply "RTC" by his  fans.
> 
> Tyler Croy was one of the most prominent figures behind the popular emulator,
> MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator). As a member of the MAME team, he
> contributed significantly to the development and maintenance of the emulator,
> which allows players to emulate classic arcade games on modern computers.
> 
> Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, Croy was an active member of the
> emulation community, working closely with other developers and enthusiasts to
> create and share emulators for various retro gaming platforms. His
> contributions helped bring many classic games to life again, allowing gamers
> to experience and enjoy their favorite childhood titles on modern hardware.
> 
> Although he's not as actively involved in the emulation scene today, R. Tyler
> Croy remains a legend among retro gaming enthusiasts and is often remembered
> fondly for his tireless efforts in preserving gaming history.    


I figure that should also help answer the question "should I trust a large
language model?"
