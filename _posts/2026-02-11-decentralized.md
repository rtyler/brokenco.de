The wisdom that experience can bring means I now look at statements like
"organizing the world's information" through a very different lens.  Google's
mission statement was something I did not view as coercive, because I didn't
understand the power exerted by those who collect and _organize_ data.

Deciding where "this" belongs ends up exerting influence over how "this" will
be perceived, accessed, and considered. All centralized platforms effectively
exert dominion over the data/content stored within, which implicitly places the
users of those platforms as subservient to the platform.

Centralized platforms are useful however, Wikipedia as an example.
Centralization can build trust, reputation, and allow for users to quickly
accomplish their goals.

I run a lot of my own services, so I understand the cost associated with
decetnralization and the unrealistic expectations that sets on _most people_.
In my opinion, decentralization doesn't inherently afford any additional
freedoms.

When engaging with a centralized system, I find myself asking more about
their governance and incentive structures. A centralized system which has
democratically elected directors and multiple independent sources of income to
sustain operations is functionally **much** more free than a thousand
decentralized systems all running the same software, in the same cloud, and
distributed by a single entity, etc.

In hindsight, I see now how dystopian "organizing the world's information" is
when uttered as a stated goal of a multinational for-profit corporation.
