Cycling in northern California is something special. Over the past few decades
Sonoma county has produced numerous professional mountain, road, and cyclocross
athletes. Cycling is an institution, _everybody_ is riding the roads or the
mountains around here. It is not uncommon to see beat-up work trucks, Rivians,
sensible sedans, and everything in between parked near some of our mountain
biking trails.

There are also a bunch of youth programs, development teams, and activities to
encourage kids to get and enjoy the great riding we have to offer. Somewhere
along the lines I became aware of the [Blue Tailed
Skinks](https://www.bluetailedskinks.com/).

> families can ride, connect, and grow together.

I was so impressed with what the Skinks were doing, and what they mean for the
future of cycling in Sonoma county that I stepped into the role of
**Treasurer** for the organization.

I aim to help the Blue Tailed Skinks continue to their
sustainable model for getting kids on bikes, teaching them to appreciate what
makes Sonoma county so special, and hopefully develop future generations of
cyclists.

This year we are hiring a full-time Executive Director to mature the
organization and build for the future in a meaningful way that requires a
dedicated professional.
