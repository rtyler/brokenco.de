I deploy on Friday. I have heard the arguments to the contrary and I still
continue to deploy on Friday. The end of the week is as good as any other to
deploy! Why wait another two days to realize the value or return-on-investment
from the work I have queued up? I feel confident making this judgement call for
two important reasons: I am confident in the success of the changes being
deployed **and** I am willing to take ownership for when I'm wrong.

My current role as a "Principal Infrastructure Engineer" and most of my value
comes from my understanding and judgement relating to the systems for which I
am responsible.

I would argue that _every_ developer's key value is in understanding and
judgement. If you do not understand what it is you're doing or when _not_ to do
something, what exactly differentiates you from the lowest possible
wage-worker?

Setting aside [the
executives](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/a-company-reminder-for-everyone-to-talk-nicely-about-the-giant-plagiarism-machine)
and their "AI agenda", the zealous adoption of "AI assistants" for software
development by _developers_ conveys a pretty key misunderstanding of "what is
is you actually do here."

If your job is to slap out code regardless of whether it works or not, then
yes, a large-language model is coming for your job.  But you know what else is
coming for that job? Better abstractions or even cloud-native services are
_also_ coming for that job. I remember working with a number of talented
Database Administrators (DBAs) when my career started in the early 2000's. I
have not worked with somebody whose title has been DBA in almost a decade.
First Percona and then AWS Aurora made it possible for _lots_ of
organizations to not need a DBA. 

Their "code" was not their value. 

Those talented DBAs were _not_ simply adding indexes to tables, reviewing
schemas, and tuning MySQL black magic. They were _understanding_ what the
application needed from the database and vice versa. They're still gainfully
employed, but they're no longer called DBAs, they're Cloud Architects or DevOps
Magicians or whatever.

Fundamentally almost every _coding_ job is temporary in the technology
ecosystem. At the beginning of my career I remember companies hiring ASP and
ColdFusion developers. If you hung your hat on being either of those, you were
probably put out of work by PHP maturing or platforms like
[Drupal](https://drupal.org) coming onto the scene.

[This post](https://aus.social/@jackscottau/114538277071339204) captures a
hypothesis that I have shared with some close friends:

> I've now had several clients come to me to take over projects that another
> agency was working on because the other agency started using generative AI.
> Apparently there was a real drop in product quality. I wonder why.

With large companies like [Microsoft claiming up to 30% code written by
AI](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/microsoft-ceo-says-up-to-30-of-the-companys-code-was-written-by-ai/),
I feel _more_ confident in my future career prospects.

As developers, our job is **not** to produce code.

Code is a result of understanding the problem and judgement in creating a
solution.
