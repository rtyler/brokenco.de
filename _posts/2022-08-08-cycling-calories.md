title: Cycling through calories

I never really paid attention to the calories burned during cycling until
recently, and it's still somewhat shocking when I look at it. With my love of
cycling rekindled by [AIDS/LifeCycle](https://aidslifecycle.org) I have spent a
lot more time in the saddle this year. Between short criterium races, my
longest at 140mi, or the most elevation with the [Death
Ride](https://deathride.com/), I have needed to be very mindful of my nutrition
before, during, and after these rides. In short, cycling can burn a **lot** of calories.

The "nutrition facts" panel on commercially sold food typically accounts for a
2,000 calorie daily allocation. This is a rough approximation of what the
average American should eat. Reasonable I suppose, but let me share some of the
calorie _expenditures_ estimated on my recent rides:

* [Patterson Pass Road Race](https://www.strava.com/activities/7599724946), 43mi, 4,400ft elevation: **2,400** calories
* [Sonoma Parks tour](https://www.strava.com/activities/7599724946), 140mi, 6,700ft elevation: **5,122** calories
* [Death ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/7481018521), 103mi, 14,000ft elevation: **7,557** calories

The numbers are insane! I expect that I need almost 3,000 calories a day just
to keep my weight and activity levels normal. That means for these more
significant rides my body requires 3-4x the average daily suggested intake.

"I wish I could eat like you!"

I will frequently get comments about my appetite. Eating 3-5k calories a day is
quite the challenge! Are you sure you're up to it? ðŸ˜„

Because I have no idea what a thousand calories look like, I have had to enlist
the help of a calorie tracker. In doing so I have learned a few things:

* Making each meal ~1k calories is *hard*, especially challenging when eating vegetarian.
* The day needs four meals, not three.
* Feeling hungry during the day is a sign that I'm behind.
* "Palate Fatigue" is a thing.

Nutrition science is something I am learning more serious athletes
spend a *lot* of time thinking about and experimenting with. Logically it makes
sense: if your body is the engine, food is the fuel and something you should be
optimizing to improve performance. As a lay person it is still surprising to me
how rudimentary my own nutrition education was, remember the food pyramid?

There's still a lot to learn and tune with my own nutrition as it relates to my
weight and performance. I wish I had useful tips to share, but the experience
is so individualized that I think you may be best suited exploring what works
best for you. Keeping track of calories, macronutrients, and expenditures is a
start, but there's a _lot_ worth exploring!
