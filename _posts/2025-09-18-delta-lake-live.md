Every Tuesday morning at 7am I have a date.

For the past few weeks [Robert](https://github.com/roeap) and I have been
jumping onto a shared [Twitch](https://twitch.ttv/agentdero) stream and working
through issues, code reviews, and design discussions for the
[delta-rs](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs) project.

The idea for the project came up at Data and AI Summit earlier this year.
Robert lives in Europe and I am as west as west coast in the US generally gets.
The timezone spread has been making collaboration difficult on the topics which
require lively synchronous debate. 

The Delta Lake project is open source and therefore, in my opinion, the discussions and development of the project should also be open! What better than a big open live stream to work through column mapping, deletion vectors, bugs, performance challenges, and more!


I have livestreamed development [in the
past](/2012/08/28/pairing-with-the-fourth-wall) and found it useful, but with
"Delta Lake Live!" we have a much more regular schedule, agenda, and way for
folks in the chat to engage, making it all that much more fun!

The streams are [also being archived on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EZM0AbLkWU&list=PLzxP01GQMpjdXtIAVxv_ziQHqyhaEhAVh)
but you're more than welcome to pop by and hang out [every Tuesday at 7am
PDT](https://www.twitch.tv/agentdero/schedule)
