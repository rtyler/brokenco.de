Last week as part Delta Hack 2021 I hosted a live coding stream to introduce
new-comers to Rust or [delta-rs](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs) to both
Rust and contributing to the project. I have been enjoying writing code live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/agentdero) which is typically more akin to [pairing with the fourth wall](/2012/08/28/pairing-with-the-fourth-wall.html). This session was different in that I was intentionally start at a more foundational level: getting started with Rust itself.

I don't know whether or not I hit the mark, but it was a fun stream nonetheless, the recording of which you can watch below:
