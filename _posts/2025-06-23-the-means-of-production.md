The discourse around "AI" has _finally_ started to shift to a very key
question: who are the winners and the losers? The fundamental thesis of shoving
Large Language Models (LLMs) into everything is that it will _increase
productivity_. Setting aside the question on whether those productivity gains
are happening or even possible, the question of _who reaps those rewards_ is
starting to become a larger concern by software developers I follow.

The post-Industrial Revolution economy is centered around ever-increasing gains
in productivity. Increased efficiencies help companies grow and best their
competitors. One of the oldest questions in capitalism is: _who_
should benefit from those gains? Capital or labor?

In the US the beneficiaries of efficiency have been _overwhelmingly_ Capital.
Since the Reagan administration, when [Reagan's tax
cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagan_tax_cuts) radically changed taxes
for the rich, the power of Capital and wealth inequality has skyrocketed.


Software and information technology has helped produce _even more_ wealth
inequality due to the incredible automation gains. Software developers command
higher than median middle-class salaries because of our ability to create new
efficiencies. I have seen some analyses claim that developers are complicit in
the creation of more wealth inequality. I generally disagree with this point,
for every 10,000 software developers there's a billionaire who represents
Capital exploiting _their_ efficiencies for their own gains.

From my perspective software developers are **always** part of Labor. Having a
solid middle-class salary does not make one part of the Capital class, we must
still labor every day to pay our bills.

In all the discussion around automation, productivity, hype, and lies, I do
feel like much of "AI-assisted software development" discourse is _missing the point_.

**If** efficiencies are gained by "AI assisted development" will _you_ see any of the benefit?

The answer is an unambiguous **no**.

A software developer that is able to spit out _more and more_ AI-driven code,
even if it somehow works, will _never_ see returns in the form of higher wages.
AI-driven code is more likely to drive wages **lower** as
businesses try to squeeze more out of fewer and fewer developers.

We should all be asking ourselves and our employers: if AI is expected to drive
20-50% improvements in productivity, what portion of that will we receive?

There have been a number of articles written by others in the software space
which I can recommend:

* [Pulling the ladder up behind us](https://xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/) by Xe
* [Lucidity's spit-take on AI](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/contra-ptaceks-terrible-article-on-ai/)
* [Trusting your own judgement on 'AI'](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2025/trusting-your-own-judgement-on-ai/) by Baldur


I don't have any more novel analysis to offer in addition to theirs.

The largest benefit to software development that I have seen from AI is that
we're finally discussing the value and power of Labor in software.
