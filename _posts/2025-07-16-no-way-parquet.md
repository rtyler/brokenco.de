The layers of abstraction in most technology stacks has gotten incredibly deep
over the last decade. At some point way down there in the depths of _most_ data
applications somebody _somewhere_ has to actually read or write bytes to
storage. The flexibility of [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org) has me
increasingly convinced that it just might be the **last data file format I will
need**.

In my [previous post](/2025/06/24/low-latency-parquet.html) on the subject I
wrote about the file format's novelty for semi-random data access _inside_ of a
`.aparquet` file. I'm certainly wondering off the beaten path with Apache
Parquet already. _Then_ this blog post kind of blew my mind: [Embedding
User-Defined Indexes in Apache Parquet
Files](https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2025/07/14/user-defined-parquet-indexes/).

Emphasis mine. 

This is news to me.

And this is _absolutely wild_.

The authors' approach for embedding user-defined indexes in Apache Parquet
files is certainly novel and already worth a read. 

But the fact that you can shove arbitrary blocks of bytes in the middle of the
otherwise columnar data format is _incredible_.


Modifications of Apache Parquet files still requires a rewrite of the
object which means `.parquet` is not a file format to be used for heavy data
modification workloads.

Use-cases with large amounts of metadata and binary data however would fit nicely
within this parquet + unknown bytes design. Parquet readers which are ignorant
to the purpose for these unknown byte blocks will completely ignore them. 

Altogether this is a new super
power, and I am contemplating whether I can use it for good or evil..
