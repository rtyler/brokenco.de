Today I launched a new rework of
[buoyantdata.com](https://www.buoyantdata.com) thanks to the work of a designer
I found in the fediverse! The original "design" of the site was something I had
cobbled together with a Jekyll theme I originally ported to
[Cobalt](https://cobalt-org.github.io/), but it was always lacking.

The release of [Delta Lake The Definitive
Guide](/2024/11/15/deltalake-the-definitive-guide.html) offered motivation to
update the site to help prospective customers understand what Buoyant Data can
do for them. I asked around on [Mastodon](https://hacky.town/@rtyler) for
recommendations for a web designer in the US would would be open to a
short-term contract to perform some renovations.

[Ben Sulzinsky](https://bgsulz.com/) was one of the talented folks who reached out to offer to help and we quickly turned a _lot_ of ideas around.

I am quite pleased with Ben's work. He did a fantastic job taking a laundry
list of both highly-specific and rather vague requirements, and turning them
into re-usable components, structure, and styles. I would certainly recommend
you work with him too!

Periodically I'll see solicitations to be `#fedihired` in Mastodon, I'm happy to have been able to fedi-hire somebody! (_even if only for a short-term contract_)
