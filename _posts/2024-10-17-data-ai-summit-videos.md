This year has been so jam packed full of activities that I forgot to share some
videos from [Data and AI Summit
2024](https://www.buoyantdata.com/blog/2024-06-04-data-and-ai-summit.html) this
past summer! The annual conference hosted by Databricks has become one of my
favorites to meet with other [Delta Lake](https://delta.io) users and
developers to discuss the future of large-scale data ingestion and processing. This year however, I overdid it a little bit.


Using the excuse of promoting my consulting/professional services company
[Buoyant Data](https://buoyantdata.com) I had effectively _three_ speaking
engagements:

* **The road to delta-rs 1.0** at the Open Source Contributor Summit (Monday)
* **Fast, cheap, and easy data ingestion with AWS Lambda and Delta Lake**, a
  talk highlighting a lot of the successful patterns I have developed for
  customers using AWS Lambda with Delta Lake for Rust to create shockingly
  cheap data ingestion pipelines. (Thursday)
* **Let's do data engineering in Rust!**, a more fun deep-dive talk to help
  people start to get into the world of implementing data systems with Rust. (Thursday)(

Unfortunately the first talk was not recorded, but it was probably the most
interesting! On Monday morning I was riding my bike from the Ferry Building to
the venue in San Francisco and my chain snapped off while I was sprinting off
from a green light. I went down **hard**, scraped up my knees, and generally
looked a fool lying in the middle of Market St.

The show must go on, so I hobbled to the [Scribd](https://tech.scribd.com)
office, deposited my broken bike, and continued to the Open Source Summit.

What I did not know at the time was that I had fractured a bone in my wrist. I
did know however that I needed to go to a clinic, but _really_ wanted to attend
the summit and take advantage of the one-a-year opportunity (literally!) for
some of the brightest minds in the data community to talk about the future of
Delta Lake and more.

So that first talk was given with my swollen wrist pulled to my heart, like a
broken wing, and I'm _sure_ it was a ludicrous sight to see!


By Thursday my arm had been set and was in a sling, which is far less exciting.
Nonetheless, the two talks below are perhaps the only one-handed presentations
thus far in my career! I hope you enjoy!

_Note_: The presentation software used for this talk is the open source
[presenterm](https://mfontanini.github.io/presenterm/introduction.html) tool
which is delightful for creating development-focused presentations like this
one!
