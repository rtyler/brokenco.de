I was lucky enough to [record a podcast
episode](https://dataengineeringcentral.substack.com/p/the-lakehouse-architecture-multimodal)
with Daniel Beach of Data Engineering Central. Daniel and I have known each
other for a couple years sharing notes and ideas on the state of the ecosystem,
where it falls down, and where things are getting interesting.

In my opinion [Data Engineering
Central](https://dataengineeringcentral.substack.com) has been one of the most
useful broad-ranged surveys of the ecosystem, curated by one crazy
mid-westerner: Daniel. He pulls no punches and while we share criticisms of AI
in the industry and commercial tools, Daniel's honesty also has put some of my
work on blast, such as [this
post](https://dataengineeringcentral.substack.com/p/_internaldeltaprotocolerror)
about some terrible user-experience and lopsided Delta Lake support in
[delta-rs](https://github.com/delta-io/deltars).

In his post Daniel highlights some of the topics we got into during our time chatting:

> * What the Lakehouse architecture gets right—and where it still falls short
> * Why multimodal data (text, images, audio, video, embeddings) changes everything
> * How open table formats like Delta Lake fit into the next generation of data platforms
> * The growing gap between data tooling hype and day-to-day data engineering reality
> * What skills and architectural thinking will matter most for data engineers over the next decade
